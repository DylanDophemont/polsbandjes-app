# Wristband App
This application was made for a school project and was one out of three parts of a prototype for replacing conventional payment methods at big outdoor events.
This simple Android app is able to read NFC-tags (the wristband) that are paired to individual customers. 
When tapping a Android phone with the installed app to the NFC-tag, the app will gather information, such as the number of credits, from the second part of the prototype, the API and database.
